To add this bot to your server:

1. Download the repo
2. Install Python3 (Or node if discord.io ever works again)
3. Create new bot account on discord
4. Get auth token from discord and add to a file called auth.json
      (format should be like 
          {
            "token": "<token here>"
          }
      )
5. Run "python bot.py"
  
And it should run. May need to install some python libraries, never dealt with this kind of thing before

To add this bot to your server:

1. Download the repo
2. Install node
3. Create new bot account on discord
4. Get auth token from discord and add to a file called auth.json
      (format should be like 
          {
            "token": "<token here>"
          }
      )
5. Run "npm install"
6. Run "node bot.js"
  
And it should run. May need to install more stuff.
